# socket - Sadly this is horribly optimized so theres a few steps to get full functionality

To run the app -
1.run npm run devStart
2.Go live with live server on the "server.js"
3.Set line 3 on server.js to the url of your live server page i.e <!-- origin: ["http://127.0.0.1:5500"] -->
4.Copy original URL for each tab if you want multiple users
